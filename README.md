# Data Structures and Algorithms (LeetCode)

This repo contains my solutions to leetcode problems tackling various data structures and algorithms. In each solution my aim is to provide the space and time complexity.

Note that the solutions will be written using JavaScript. I may fiddle with Typescript/Python here and there.

The aim of this exercise is to better familiarize myself with common data structures and algorithms and how they may be applied in day-to-day tasks.

// You are given two strings word1 and word2.
// Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1.
// If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

// Return the merged string.

// Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
// Output: "apbqcr"
// Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
// word1:  a   b   c
// word2:    p   q   r
// merged: a p b q c r

// Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
// Output: "apbqrs"
// Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
// word1:  a   b
// word2:    p   q   r   s
// merged: a p b q   r   s

// Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
// Output: "apbqcd"
// Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
// word1:  a   b   c   d
// word2:    p   q
// merged: a p b q c   d
